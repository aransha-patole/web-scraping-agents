# Recent Studies (Web Scraping + Web Agents + Security)

## Web agents & benchmarks
- WebArena is a realistic environment + benchmark for evaluating web agents on multi-step tasks. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}
- Work on “API-based” or “hybrid” agents argues some tasks are better solved by combining APIs with browsing. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

## Security of web-use / browsing agents
- Research highlights new threat surfaces when agents browse untrusted pages (prompt/goal injection, malicious web content). :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

## Industry reports & scaling challenges
- Scaling Playwright/Puppeteer scraping faces operational issues (browser farms, bans, IP reputation). :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}
- Industry trend reporting notes growth in “AI-driven automation” and a shift toward more intentional, relationship-based web data collection. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}
