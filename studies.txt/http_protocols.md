### HTTP Protocols

Web scraping starts with understanding HTTP.

- Browsers and scrapers communicate with servers using HTTP requests.
- Important request components:
  - Method: GET / POST
  - Headers: User-Agent, Cookies, Accept-Language
- Important response codes:
  - 200 → Success
  - 403 → Forbidden (blocked)
  - 429 → Too Many Requests (rate-limited)

Servers use HTTP metadata to detect non-human traffic.
