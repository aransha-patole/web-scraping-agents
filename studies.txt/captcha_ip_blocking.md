### CAPTCHA & IP Blocking

Websites defend against automation using:
- CAPTCHA challenges
- IP-based rate limiting
- Browser fingerprinting
- Session validation

CAPTCHA exists to confirm human presence.
Ethical scrapers treat CAPTCHA as a stop signal, not something to bypass.

IP blocking occurs when:
- Requests are too frequent
- Headers look unnatural
- Traffic patterns resemble bots
