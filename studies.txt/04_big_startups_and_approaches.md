# Big Startups & Approaches: From Scraping → Web Agents

## Yutori (agents doing everyday web tasks)
Yutori frames the space as building agents that can reliably handle everyday digital tasks on the web, and discusses the split between text/DOM-based agents vs visual/computer-use agents. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## OpenAI (Operator / Computer-Using Agent / Deep Research)
OpenAI describes agents that can interact with the same interfaces humans use (browser/GUI) and emphasizes tool-using training for web-scale research. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

## Anthropic (Computer Use models)
Anthropic describes “computer use” as models that interact with interfaces directly, plus safety considerations for that capability. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

## Perplexity (crawlers + robots controls + web ecosystem tensions)
Perplexity documents how its crawlers can be managed via robots.txt directives. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
There’s also active industry debate around bot identity, blocking, and “stealth crawling” allegations—important context when discussing scraping at scale. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

## Browser Infrastructure Startups (Browserbase)
Some startups provide “browser infrastructure” for agents/scrapers: scalable hosted browsers compatible with Playwright/Puppeteer, with observability and operational features. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
