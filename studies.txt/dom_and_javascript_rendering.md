### DOM & JavaScript Rendering

The DOM (Document Object Model) is a tree representation of a webpage.

Two types of websites:
1. Static pages – data present in HTML
2. Dynamic pages – data injected by JavaScript after load

For dynamic pages:
- Initial HTML contains placeholders
- JavaScript fetches data via APIs
- DOM updates asynchronously

This is why traditional HTTP-based scraping sometimes returns empty pages.
